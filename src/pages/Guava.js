            The Guava Wallet app is a self-custody wallet thatâ€™s your portal to
            web3, where you can swap crypto with no network fees on Polygon.

            and Ethereum networks, which means you hold and maintain the private
            key to your assets. Stay tuned, because weâ€™ll be adding more
            networks to guava Wallet in the future, too.

            Guava app currently does not charge service fees on token swaps.
            Fees are subject to change.
            Network fees, or gas fees, are blockchain transaction processing
            fees. These required fees are submitted to the network along with
            your transaction. The fee fluctuates based on the volume of
            transactions, confirmation speed, and transaction size for that
            network. Network fees may apply for token approvals, transfers to an
            external wallet, and interacting with dapps. guava Wallet doesnâ€™t
            collect any part of the network fee.
